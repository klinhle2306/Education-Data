1. Desciption: This project utilizes two data sets. The main data set is the EdGap data set from [EdGap.org](https://www.edgap.org/#5/37.875/-96.987). This data set from 2016 includes the average ACT or SAT scores and its socioeconomic characteristics of the school district. The secondary data set includes the basic information about each school from the [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp).

2. Data: 

  a. All socioeconomic data (household income, unemployment, adult educational attainment, and family structure) are from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey. [EdGap.org](https://www.edgap.org/#5/37.875/-96.987) report that ACT and SAT score data is from each state's department of education or some other public data release.

  b. The school information data is from the [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp). This data set consists of basic identifying information about schools and can be assumed to be of reasonably high quality. This data set can be access [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lkl5nvcdmwyoban/ccd_sch_029_1617_w_1a_11212017.csv?dl=0).

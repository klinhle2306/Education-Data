DATA 3320 Class Project

1. Desciption: This project utilizes two data sets. The primary data set is the EdGap data set from [EdGap.org](https://www.edgap.org/#5/37.875/-96.987). This data set from 2016 includes information about average ACT or SAT scores for schools and several socioeconomic characteristics of the school district. The secondary data set is basic information about each school from the [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp).

2. Data: 

  a. All socioeconomic data (household income, unemployment, adult educational attainment, and family structure) are from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey. 

[EdGap.org](https://www.edgap.org/#5/37.875/-96.987) report that ACT and SAT score data is from each state's department of education or some other public data release. The nature of the other public data release is not known. The quality of the census data and the department of education data can be assumed to be reasonably high. [EdGap.org](https://www.edgap.org/#5/37.875/-96.987) do not indicate that they processed the data in any way. The data were assembled by the [EdGap.org](https://www.edgap.org/#5/37.875/-96.987) team, so there is always the possibility for human error. Given the public nature of the data, we would be able to consult the original data sources to check the quality of the data if we had any questions.

  b. The school information data is from the [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp). This data set consists of basic identifying information about schools and can be assumed to be of reasonably high quality. As for the EdGap.org data, the school information data is public, so we would be able to consult the original data sources to check the quality of the data if we had any questions.
